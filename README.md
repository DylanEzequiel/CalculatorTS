# Calculator with TypeScript
An simple Project, just as me.

## Technologies
These are the **Technologies** I used to build this simple Calculator:
- **HTML** (2nd. Most used)
- **CSS** (1st. Most used)
- **TypeScript** (3rd. Most used)

> Note: It is created with TypeScript, but for file reading reasons it is compiled to native JavaScript via: `tsc`.

## Working
It is an regular website, the calculator is in middle of it, it works like other one, is simple as that. To use it you can't use your keyboard,
you need to use the keypad in the calculator, there are **3 Special Cases**:
- **=**.- It will output the result of operation in display panel.
- **C**.- Clears all displayed content.
- **‚Üê**.- Clears the last character displayed.
